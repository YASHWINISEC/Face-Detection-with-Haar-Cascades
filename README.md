# 👁️ Face Detection Project

## 🧩 Overview
This project demonstrates **human face detection** using computer vision.  
It leverages pre-trained models to automatically identify facial regions in images or video streams and mark them with bounding boxes.  
The goal is to provide a simple, accurate, and efficient approach to understanding the basics of facial detection — serving as a stepping stone toward more advanced tasks like **facial recognition, emotion analysis, and real-time surveillance**.

## 🎯 Project Objective
The main objectives of this project are:
- To detect human faces from images or webcam feeds.  
- To understand how OpenCV and pre-trained classifiers work for face detection.  
- To visualize the detection process in real-time.  
- To build a foundation for deep learning–based face recognition models.

## ⚙️ Features
✅ Detects multiple faces in one image.  
✅ Supports both static images and live webcam input.  
✅ Uses pre-trained Haar Cascade or DNN models for detection.  
✅ Displays bounding boxes around detected faces.  
✅ Easy to customize and extend for future features.

## 🧾 Working Process
1. **Input Loading:** Load an image or start webcam capture.  
2. **Preprocessing:** Convert the image to grayscale for faster computation.  
3. **Model Loading:** Load the pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier for face detection.  
4. **Detection:** Scan the image for face-like patterns using sliding window and feature matching.  
5. **Output Visualization:** Draw bounding boxes around detected faces and display results.
